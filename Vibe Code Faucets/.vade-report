Implemented Vercel Speed Insights integration as requested.

## Summary
Successfully integrated Vercel Speed Insights into the testnet-faucet-aggregator project. This enables real-time performance monitoring and Web Vitals tracking for the application deployed on Vercel.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **package.json** - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` v1.3.1 as a production dependency
2. **src/main.jsx** - Integrated the `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`

### Updated Dependencies:
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` to production dependencies

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows best practices for React applications:

1. **Dependency Installation**: Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm, which updated package-lock.json with all necessary transitive dependencies.

2. **Component Integration**: Added the `SpeedInsights` component to the main React application in `src/main.jsx`. The component is placed within React.StrictMode alongside the existing Analytics component, ensuring it runs alongside other Vercel tracking utilities.

3. **Framework Compatibility**: The project uses React 18 with Vite as the build tool. We utilized the React-specific import path (`@vercel/speed-insights/react`) as recommended in the Vercel documentation for React applications.

## How It Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
- The Speed Insights tracking script will be automatically enabled
- Web Vitals metrics (Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS) will be collected from real users
- Performance data will appear in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab
- The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be automatically added by Vercel's infrastructure

## Verification

- ✅ Package installed successfully without conflicts
- ✅ Build completes successfully with no errors
- ✅ No existing functionality disrupted
- ✅ Implementation follows existing project patterns (placed alongside Analytics component)
- ✅ All lock files updated correctly

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged and deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel project dashboard (if not already enabled)
2. Wait for real user traffic to accumulate performance data
3. Monitor metrics in the Vercel dashboard Speed Insights tab

## Notes

- The SpeedInsights component is non-intrusive and lightweight
- It automatically tracks Core Web Vitals without additional configuration
- The component works alongside the existing Vercel Analytics integration
- For production deployment, Speed Insights will automatically collect and report metrics to Vercel's infrastructure
