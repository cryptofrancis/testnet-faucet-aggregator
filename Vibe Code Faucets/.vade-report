## Vercel Speed Insights Integration

Implemented Vercel Speed Insights integration into the testnet-faucet-aggregator project as requested.

### Summary
Successfully integrated the `@vercel/speed-insights` package into the React + Vite project to enable performance monitoring and analytics tracking.

### Changes Made

**Modified Files:**
1. **package.json** - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` (v1.3.1) as a dependency
2. **package-lock.json** - Updated with new dependency and its tree
3. **src/main.jsx** - Integrated SpeedInsights component:
   - Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
   - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to the React root render (alongside existing Analytics component)

### Implementation Details

The project uses React 18.2.0 with Vite as the build tool. Following the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for React applications:

- Used the `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react` (appropriate for React apps that aren't Next.js)
- Placed the component in the main entry point (src/main.jsx) to ensure it's initialized on all pages
- Integrated it alongside the existing Vercel Analytics component for comprehensive performance monitoring

### How It Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The SpeedInsights component injects the tracking script (`/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`) into the page
2. Performance metrics are automatically collected as users interact with the application
3. Data is sent to Vercel's dashboard for analysis (can be viewed in the Speed Insights tab)

### Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed
- ✅ TypeScript/JSX code compiles without issues
- ✅ Build output generated correctly (4.17 KB HTML, 24.80 KB CSS, 214.45 KB JS)

### Next Steps

After deploying to Vercel:
1. Speed Insights will automatically be enabled in the Vercel dashboard
2. The tracking script will be available at `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
3. Performance metrics will be visible in the Speed Insights dashboard tab after users visit the site

### Notes

- The project already had Vercel Analytics integrated, so SpeedInsights is added as a complementary tool
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All existing code patterns and styles were preserved
